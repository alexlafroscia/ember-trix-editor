# ember-trix-editor

An Ember wrapper for the [Trix editor](https://github.com/basecamp/trix).
You can also [visit our demo](http://lynnetye.github.io/ember-trix-editor).

This add-on is consistent with the Ember "actions up, data down" pattern, making
the Trix editor available as a component in any Ember.js application.

###"Data down" to `{{trix-editor}}` (optional)
* `attachmentsDisabled` (boolean)
* `autofocus` (boolean)
* `editorClass` (styling formatted content)
* `placeholder`
* `value` (to populate with stored content)

### "Actions up" from `{{trix-editor}}`
* `trix-attachment-add`
* `trix-attachment-remove`
* `trix-blur`
* `trix-change`
* `trix-file-accept`
* `trix-focus`
* `trix-initialize`
* `trix-selection-change`
* (all actions send jQuery event, from which the original event and editor
property can be extracted)
